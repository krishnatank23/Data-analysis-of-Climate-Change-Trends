# 🌍 Exploring Climate Changes Over Time  

This repository contains the project **"Exploring Climate Changes Over Time"**, created as part of the **Interactive Data Visualization (DS612)** course at Dhirubhai Ambani University.  
The project examines climate change indicators from 1990 onwards using **Python for data preprocessing** and **Tableau for interactive visualizations and analysis**.

## 📌 Project Overview  
Climate change is a major global challenge, influenced by human activities such as industrialization, agriculture, food systems, and urbanization.  

This project explores:  
- Temperature deviations across countries (1990–present)  
- CO₂ emissions and their relationship with temperature rise  
- Industrial, agricultural, and food system contributions to emissions  
- Urban vs rural and coastal vs landlocked country patterns  

The objective is to uncover meaningful insights, test hypotheses, and visualize patterns to better understand the drivers of climate change.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze **temperature anomalies** over decades, continents, and countries.  
- Study the link between **emissions (industrial, agricultural, food system)** and climate change.  
- Compare **urban vs rural** and **coastal vs landlocked** nations.  
- Test hypotheses on population growth, land use, and sectoral impacts.  
- Communicate findings with **interactive Tableau dashboards**.  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
The final dataset was created by merging and preprocessing multiple sources using Python:  
- **FAO Climate Change Indicators (FAOSTAT)**  
- **Global CO₂ Emission Data (Kaggle)**  

**Key columns include:**  
- Country, Year, Temperature Change  
- CO₂ emissions (industrial, agricultural, food-related)  
- Urban & Rural population data  
- Net forest conversion and land cover changes  
- Derived fields: Urban Ratio, Food System Emission, Industrial Emission, Agriculture Emission, Total Population  

---

## 📈 Key Insights  
- 🌊 Coastal vs Landlocked → Similar warming trends observed.  
- 🏭 Urban-dominant nations → Higher **industrial emissions**.  
- 🌾 Rural nations → Higher **agriculture-related emissions**.  
- 🍽 Food systems → Significant but often underestimated contributors.  
- 🌲 Urbanization → Strongly linked to **deforestation and forest conversion**.  

---

## 📷 Tools & Visualizations  
- **Python** → Preprocessing, data cleaning, and feature engineering.  
- **Tableau** → Dashboards, charts, and interactive visualizations including:  
  - Decadal and continental temperature deviation trends  
  - Correlation plots (emissions vs temperature anomalies)  
  - Choropleth maps of global warming patterns  
  - Stacked bar charts for emission categories  
  - Urban vs rural, coastal vs landlocked comparisons  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** → Pandas, NumPy  
- **Tableau** → Interactive dashboards & visual analytics  
- **Data Sources** → FAO, Kaggle datasets

## 📢 Conclusion  
The analysis shows strong correlations between **CO₂ emissions (especially industrial and food systems)** and rising temperature anomalies. It highlights that climate change impacts are **universal, not geography-bound**, reinforcing the urgent need for sustainable practices and emission reduction policies.
